# Homework 2
### Project Team:
Sahib Bajwa

### Assumptions:
I made a good ammount of assumptions as to how simple I could make the project. The assignment did not say things like to encapsulate, etc. For my UML drawings, I think that I could have done much more for them (specifically UML diagram 3), but I assumed that there would be no need. This is completely my fault that I don't feel the need to elaborate to such a high degree for the UML diagrams. I also assumed that I could put my functions or attributes wherever I wanted as long as they worked.

### Issues Encountered:
Large ammount of issues getting started with the UMLs. I also believe that I did not do project 1 the best, my project 2 is a bit chaotic when it comes to where the functions are called from (where they live).

### Running the Application:
I run the application by running the main function/class in Eclipse IDE, I generated the UMLs using Visual Paradigm along with Eclipse.
