# Homework 1
### Project Team:
Sahib Bajwa

### Assumptions:
One assumption I made was that whenever the zookeeper completed an action, I should print out the action AND I should print out what the animal would do.

### Issues Encountered:
None of major importance. Assignment was tough due to figuring out how objects work, but other than that it was fine.

### Running the Application:
I run the application by running the main function/class in Eclipse IDE.
